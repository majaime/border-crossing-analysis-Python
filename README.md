# Insight Coding Challenge: Notes on my coding structure and strategy

1- The main Python code (called border_crossing_analysis.py) is written in Python Community version 2019.2 installed on an Ubuntu 18.04 environment.

2- The structure of the repository follows the rules provided. Successful runs of "run_tests.sh" file confirms this.

3- According to the instructions provided in the "run.sh" file, the code is readable, compilable, and executable on any system.

4- I thought of a few ways of solving this problem, one of which is applying dictionary concept. One of the advantages of using dictionary is providing one or multiple "key(s)". They allow for better search and sorting based on the users expectations. Another way could be using nested conditional loops which searches for matches.

5- I tested this code for a larger dataset which was provided and successfully passed it!
